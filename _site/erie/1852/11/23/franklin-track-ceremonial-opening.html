            Franklin track ceremonial opening
            
          <small>published 1852-11-23</small>
          <p>On November 17th, the Franklin Canal Erie and Ohio Division railroad was completed, finishing the link from New York City to Cincinnati. The first train from Ohio pulled into Erie moments later <a class="citation" href="references.html#erieobserverFirstCars1852">(Erie Observer, 1852)</a>.</p>

<p>The following week, the railroad held a ceremonial opening with a train packed with railroad officials, reporters, and dignitaries (brought in the night before) departing Erie at 9am to Ashtabula, where it met a train from Cleveland before returning to Erie <a class="citation" href="references.html#erieobserverCelebration1852">(Erie Observer, 1852)</a>.</p>

<p>At the following party at Brown’s Hotel, a number of celebratory speeches were given, though none could avoid the rising tensions.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We have met at a marriage feast. Who are the parties to be united? Two great families East and West; not F.F.V’s, but F.F.A’s–the First Families in America! [Cheers] The two great Railroad families had resolved on a wedding, and it was thought best to have it in the Keystone State-the Keystone of the Union–in the good old Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. And why? In Pennsylvania the don’t require any marriage license! <!-- (Cheers) In Ohio they do, and the Buckeyes come to Pennsylvania to build railroads without charters--not so--a slander on the glorious old Commonwealth. (Loud applause) --></p>

  <p>– Alfred King, Mayor of Erie, paraphrased <a class="citation" href="references.html#erieobserverCelebration1852">(Erie Observer, 1852)</a></p>
</blockquote>

<!-- > Mr. President, I feel on this occasion all the gratification one can feel on the consummation of a great object which has been unsuccessfully opposed--opposed, too, with all the bitterness and the hostility that money can command.
> -->
<!-- > [The] records of the Court of this county will show that myself and Smith Jackson, who I see here at my right, were prosecuted on divers[sic] occasions for Trespass; and not only us but the laborers in our employ were indicted as criminals for attempting to build a road to unit New York with Cincinnati.

<blockquote>
  <p>Why did you build the Ohio gauge East of us, and that too in the face of the solemn enactments of Pennsylvania? Because New York and Boston owns the roads East of us as well as West of us; and great, and strong and might as they are, they are afraid to enter into a fair and open competition with Philadelphia for business here, but are fully bent on running the trade and travel of the West to a point below us, where Pennsylvania is not represented, and where she cannot come!</p>

  <p>[…] Much, continued Mr. L., has been said about corrupting the Legislature of the State to accomplish this revolting purpose. It can’t be done, gentlemen. We know yours is a purse-proud monopoly; but it can’t ride rough-shod through the Legislative halls of the State–even though your emissaries are armed with twice 50,000 arguments in the shape of dollars. Mark this!</p>

  <p>– Morrow B. Lowry, paraphrased <a class="citation" href="references.html#erieobserverCelebration1852">(Erie Observer, 1852)</a></p>
