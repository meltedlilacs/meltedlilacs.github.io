            Franklin Canal Company charter amended
            
          <small>published 1849-04-09</small>
          <p>In the same session that the Erie and Ohio Railroad’s charter was repealed, the Franklin Canal Company’s charter was amended to allow the company to construct a railroad instead of repairing the canal. The railroad would be primarily regulated by the General Railroad Law passed earlier that year on February 19th. <a class="citation" href="references.html#pennsylvaniaLawsGeneralAssembly1849">(Pennsylvania, 1849, p. 765)</a> While this law required railroad construction to be commenced within 3 years of being chartered, it had no requirement relating to the completion of the charted road. <a class="citation" href="references.html#pennsylvaniaLawsGeneralAssembly1849">(Pennsylvania, 1849, p. 79)</a></p>

<p>In addition, once the company’s stock was increased to $500,000, the railroad was further permitted to be constructed northwards to lake Erie and to to Pittsburg. It is important to note that doing so did not require a railroad along the Franklin Canal to be built. The exact path was unspecified, the company was only required to use “such route as the said company shall deem most expedient and advantageous.” <a class="citation" href="references.html#pennsylvaniaLawsGeneralAssembly1849">(Pennsylvania, 1849, p. 765)</a></p>

<!-- This amendment also allowed the company to sell public land near the canal, along with the dam and lock at Franklin, $1,500 of which would be appropriated to hire contractors to remove obstructions from the creek, part of the original purpose of the company. The remainder of the profit would be paid to the state. <a class="citation" href="references.html#pennsylvaniaLawsGeneralAssembly1849">(Pennsylvania, 1849, p. 765)</a> -->
