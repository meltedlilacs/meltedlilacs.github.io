            <h3>Apr 27th, 1844 | Franklin Canal Company chartered</h3>
            <p>The Franklin Canal Company was chartered to repair the section of the Pennsylvania Canal that ran from the aqueduct crossing French Creek at Shaw’s Landing (a few miles south of Meadville) to the mouth of French Creek at the Allegheny River in Franklin. The cost of the repairs would be reimbursed by the state. The company would be regulated by the rules of the Erie Canal Charter <a class="citation" href="references.html#pennsylvaniaLawsGeneralAssembly1844">(Pennsylvania, 1844, p. 471)</a>.</p>

            <h3>Apr 9th, 1849 | Franklin Canal Company charter amended</h3>
            <p>In the same session that the Erie and Ohio Railroad’s charter was repealed, the Franklin Canal Company’s charter was amended to allow the company to construct a railroad instead of repairing the canal. The railroad would be primarily regulated by the General Railroad Law passed earlier that year on February 19th. <a class="citation" href="references.html#pennsylvaniaLawsGeneralAssembly1849">(Pennsylvania, 1849, p. 765)</a> While this law required railroad construction to be commenced within 3 years of being chartered, it had no requirement relating to the completion of the charted road. <a class="citation" href="references.html#pennsylvaniaLawsGeneralAssembly1849">(Pennsylvania, 1849, p. 79)</a></p>

<p>In addition, once the company’s stock was increased to $500,000, the railroad was further permitted to be constructed northwards to lake Erie and to to Pittsburg. It is important to note that doing so did not require a railroad along the Franklin Canal to be built. The exact path was unspecified, the company was only required to use “such route as the said company shall deem most expedient and advantageous.” <a class="citation" href="references.html#pennsylvaniaLawsGeneralAssembly1849">(Pennsylvania, 1849, p. 765)</a></p>

<!-- This amendment also allowed the company to sell public land near the canal, along with the dam and lock at Franklin, $1,500 of which would be appropriated to hire contractors to remove obstructions from the creek, part of the original purpose of the company. The remainder of the profit would be paid to the state. <a class="citation" href="references.html#pennsylvaniaLawsGeneralAssembly1849">(Pennsylvania, 1849, p. 765)</a> -->

            <h3>Jan 22nd, 1851 | Franklin Canal Company funds Erie and Ohio Division railroad</h3>
            <p>The Franklin Canal Company planned, through a liberal interpretation of their amended charter, to build a railroad from the Cleveland, Painesville and Ashtabula Railroad’s terminus at the Ohio border to the Erie and North East Railroad’s terminus at the Erie railroad station. The road would be built with a 4’10” gauge, the same as Ohio’s state gauge. This railroad would be called the Erie and Ohio Division, though the company never constructed any other division. They provided 3 legal opinions arguing that this road was allowed under their charter, as it approached Lake Erie through the most advantageous route, furthest from the lake at the Ohio border, and closest at Erie <a class="citation" href="references.html#PennsylvaniaSectionErie1851">(<i>Pennsylvania Section of the Erie and Cleveland Railroad</i>, 1851, pp. 14-24)</a>. The track would be 25.5 miles long, and was estimated to cost a total of $632,000 to build <a class="citation" href="references.html#PennsylvaniaSectionErie1851">(<i>Pennsylvania Section of the Erie and Cleveland Railroad</i>, 1851, p. 4)</a>. The route included a wooden trestle 115 feet high and 1,400 feet long crossing Elk Creek valley <a class="citation" href="references.html#millerTwentiethCenturyHistory1909">(Miller, 1909, p. 469)</a>.</p>

<p>In order to fund this expense, the Franklin Canal Company used a provision of the Erie Canal Company’s charter, which was used as a general charter for the Franklin company, to sell $400,000 of bonds to George S. Coe of the Ohio Life and Trust Company. These bonds were further guaranteed by the Cleveland, Painesville and Ashtabula Railroad, under an 1850 Ohio law encouraging neighboring states to build connecting railroads to Ohio <a class="citation" href="references.html#PennsylvaniaSectionErie1851">(<i>Pennsylvania Section of the Erie and Cleveland Railroad</i>, 1851, p. 12)</a>.</p>

            <h3>Nov 23rd, 1852 | Franklin track ceremonial opening</h3>
            <p>On November 17th, the Franklin Canal Erie and Ohio Division railroad was completed, finishing the link from New York City to Cincinnati. The first train from Ohio pulled into Erie moments later <a class="citation" href="references.html#erieobserverFirstCars1852">(Erie Observer, 1852)</a>.</p>

<p>The following week, the railroad held a ceremonial opening with a train packed with railroad officials, reporters, and dignitaries (brought in the night before) departing Erie at 9am to Ashtabula, where it met a train from Cleveland before returning to Erie <a class="citation" href="references.html#erieobserverCelebration1852">(Erie Observer, 1852)</a>.</p>

<p>At the following party at Brown’s Hotel, a number of celebratory speeches were given, though none could avoid the rising tensions.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We have met at a marriage feast. Who are the parties to be united? Two great families East and West; not F.F.V’s, but F.F.A’s–the First Families in America! [Cheers] The two great Railroad families had resolved on a wedding, and it was thought best to have it in the Keystone State-the Keystone of the Union–in the good old Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. And why? In Pennsylvania the don’t require any marriage license! <!-- (Cheers) In Ohio they do, and the Buckeyes come to Pennsylvania to build railroads without charters--not so--a slander on the glorious old Commonwealth. (Loud applause) --></p>

  <p>– Alfred King, Mayor of Erie, paraphrased <a class="citation" href="references.html#erieobserverCelebration1852">(Erie Observer, 1852)</a></p>
</blockquote>

<!-- > Mr. President, I feel on this occasion all the gratification one can feel on the consummation of a great object which has been unsuccessfully opposed--opposed, too, with all the bitterness and the hostility that money can command.
> -->
<!-- > [The] records of the Court of this county will show that myself and Smith Jackson, who I see here at my right, were prosecuted on divers[sic] occasions for Trespass; and not only us but the laborers in our employ were indicted as criminals for attempting to build a road to unit New York with Cincinnati.
>
> [...]

<blockquote>
  <p>Why did you build the Ohio gauge East of us, and that too in the face of the solemn enactments of Pennsylvania? Because New York and Boston owns the roads East of us as well as West of us; and great, and strong and might as they are, they are afraid to enter into a fair and open competition with Philadelphia for business here, but are fully bent on running the trade and travel of the West to a point below us, where Pennsylvania is not represented, and where she cannot come!</p>

  <p>[…] Much, continued Mr. L., has been said about corrupting the Legislature of the State to accomplish this revolting purpose. It can’t be done, gentlemen. We know yours is a purse-proud monopoly; but it can’t ride rough-shod through the Legislative halls of the State–even though your emissaries are armed with twice 50,000 arguments in the shape of dollars. Mark this!</p>

  <p>– Morrow B. Lowry, paraphrased <a class="citation" href="references.html#erieobserverCelebration1852">(Erie Observer, 1852)</a></p>
