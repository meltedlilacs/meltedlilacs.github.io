The Franklin Canal Company was chartered to repair the section of the Pennsylvania Canal that ran from the aqueduct crossing French Creek at Shaw's Landing (a few miles south of Meadville) to the mouth of French Creek at the Allegheny River in Franklin. The cost of the repairs would be reimbursed by the state. The company would be regulated by the rules of the Erie Canal Charter {% cite pennsylvaniaLawsGeneralAssembly1844 -l 471 %}.
