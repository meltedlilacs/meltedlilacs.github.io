Last fall when I came out as non-binary, I did so cautiously. First I tried out they/them pronouns anonymously in online chatrooms. This gave me a low risk way to see how comfortably the pronouns fit me. Then I began telling people, first close friends, then parents and sister, and then others on a case-by-case basis. This piecemeal approach allowed me greater control over the pacing, frequency, and participants of the potentially difficult conversations I needed to have with people, which allowed me to reduce my emotional vulnerability. The downside is that this approach carries a large mental and emotional overhead.

I determined whether or not to come out to individual people based on the frequency with which I interacted with them, how important my interactions with them were, and my expected response from the person. When I was around people who I was still closeted to, a large amount of my attention was inevitably lost to evaluating them based on these three criteria, wondering time and time again if I should come out.

The additional repercussion of being partially closeted for a substantial period was that I was misgendered more frequently. It is difficult to explain why being referred to with the wrong pronouns hurts so much. I can't directly put words to it, but imagine that you just discovered some new fundamental part of yourself, and are slowly learning to embrace it, and then someone you care about deeply accuses you, in a loving way, of lying.

I eventually got so fed up with my cautious approach that I came out on Facebook just to get it out of the way. This meant that some people learned of my identity online who really deserved an in-person conversation, but I was emotionally exhausted from coming out again and again. So this time I'm doing things differently. I'm not going to be cautious or slow.

Hello world, I'm Lilac. I prefer the pronouns she/her/hers but also use they/them/theirs. I'm still non-binary, just on the femme end of the gender spectrum. Despite using feminine pronouns, I'd rather be referred to as a person, not a man or a woman, because I don't fall into either of those categories.

Initially I was looking for an androgynous name, but after reading through lengthy lists of names online, I felt somewhat uninspired. So I branched out into slightly more femme names, and after considering other names in similar genres, a friend suggested Lilac.

I was worried I wasn't going to be able to tell if a name fit me, but hearing myself referred to as Lilac gave me far more gender euphoria than any other name I tried. My unexpected appreciation of a feminine name led me to try out the pronouns she/her/hers. I am still non-binary, just more feminine than I thought at first.

There are some disadvantages to my new tactic of openness. I am a shy person, and this is a fundamentally personal topic to talk about. My default reaction is to be embarrassed or even ashamed to tell others. But I refuse to let my internalized transphobia dictate my behaviour. The more that I understand about myself and my identity, the more confidence I find I can muster.
